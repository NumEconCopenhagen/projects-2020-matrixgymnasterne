This **exam project** consists of three problems:

In the first problem we investigate linear regressions, from which we estimate parameter values using different methods, OLS and LAD.

The second problem examines durable purchases with risk. In this problem values of different types of consumption are found to optimise the household's value of income throughout different time periods. 

In the third problem we minimise a function by implementing the algorithm of gradient descent. This enables us to run the test case.

**Dependencies**: Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, no installations are required.
