# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **The Solow model with human capital** and is about the impact of savings of human capital on production. The primary focus of the project is the effect of a rise in the savings rate of human capital on the steady states values of the model, as well as the optimal savings rate required to maximise consumption.

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, no installations are required, but to run the project sympy version 1.4 is needed.
